//! Feature version range types (org.apache.kafka.common.feature)
//!
//! # Dead-code lint
//!
//! Java marks this package "not a supported API", so it is crate-private. It
//! is translated in full (DoD #2), but the client uses only part of it; the
//! rest has no caller yet, or only the translated tests. Nothing outside the
//! crate can reach it, so the module allows dead code rather than dropping
//! Java methods.
