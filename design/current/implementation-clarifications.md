# Python interface implementation — clarifications for the owner

Branch: `dev_python-interface-implementation` (from `origin/dev_interface_consolidation`).
Per the owner's instruction (2026-09-09) the Actor/Critic loop does not stop for input; every
question is logged here with the assumption taken, and the owner is asked once at the end.

Format: `### C<n> — <title>` · **Where** · **Question** · **Assumption taken** · **Alternatives** · **Status**.

### C1 — Share consumer is out of implementation scope
- **Where:** spec §6.3 / §9 (`ShareConsumer`, `KafkaShareConsumer`, `MockShareConsumer`, `Async*`).
- **Question:** the spec defines the share consumer, but the Rust core has no share-consumer
  translation (`consumer-threading.md` §20 lists every share-consumer file as out of scope) and the
  FFI has no share entry points.
- **Assumption taken:** not implemented in this pass; the owner's instruction names "consumer and
  producer". No stub module is added (a stub raising errors would be a public surface with no core).
- **Alternatives:** translate the share consumer core first (a separate milestone).
- **Status:** open.

### C2 — Overlap fallback of the union naming rule (rule 3.4)
- **Where:** `.claude/rules/python-binding-interface.md` §3.4.
- **Question:** the owner asked that the "non-disjoint Python types → `name_type` parameters" case be
  reviewed explicitly before it is encoded as a rule.
- **Assumption taken:** written into the rule file **marked "NOT yet reviewed by the owner"**; no site
  in the producer/consumer surface needs it, so it is not applied anywhere.
- **Status:** open — owner to confirm or replace the fallback.
